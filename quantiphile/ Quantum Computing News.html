                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Quantum computers are still in their early stages of development, but they have the potential to revolutionize many fields. They use the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations that are impossible for classical computers. Quantum computers could be used to solve a wide range of problems, including climate prediction, material design, and drug discovery.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Climate prediction: Quantum computers could be used to simulate the effects of climate change on a global scale. This information could be used to develop policies to mitigate the effects of climate change.</li>
                    <li>Material design: Quantum computers could be used to design new materials with improved properties, such as strength, conductivity, and thermal stability. These materials could be used in a variety of applications, such as aerospace, energy, and healthcare.</li>
                    <li>Drug discovery: Quantum computers could be used to screen large databases of molecules to identify potential drug candidates. This could significantly reduce the time and cost of developing new drugs.</li>
