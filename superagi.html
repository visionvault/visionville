                    <p class="card-text">The moving discontinuous Galerkin method with interface condition enforcement (MDG-ICE) is a high-order, r-adaptive method that treats the grid as a variable and weakly enforces the conservation law, constitutive law, and corresponding interface conditions in order to implicitly fit high-gradient flow features. In this paper, we introduce nonlinear solver strategies to more robustly and efficiently compute high-speed viscous flows. Specifically, we incorporate an anisotropic grid regularization based on the mesh-implied metric into the nonlinear least-squares solver that inhibits grid motion in directions with small element length scales. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive elementwise regularization strategy that locally scales the regularization terms as needed to maintain grid validity. We apply the proposed MDG-ICE formulation to test cases involving viscous shocks and/or boundary layers, including Mach 17.6 hypersonic viscous flow over a circular cylinder and Mach 5 hypersonic viscous flow over a sphere, which are very challenging test cases for conventional numerical schemes on simplicial grids. Even without artificial dissipation, the computed solutions are free from spurious oscillations and yield highly symmetric surface heat-flux profiles.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">We study a class of newly-introduced CFTs associated with even quadratic forms of general signature, which we call generalized Narain theories. We first summarize the properties of these theories. We then consider orbifolds of these theories, thereby obtaining a large class of non-supersymmetric CFTs with exactly marginal deformations. We then discuss ensemble averages of such theories over their moduli space, and obtain a modular form associated with the quadratic form and an element of the discriminant group. The modular form can be written as a Poincare series, which contains novel invariants of lens spaces and suggests the interpretation of the holographic bulk as a theory of anyons.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Lattice defects have interesting effects in some quantum Hamiltonians. Here we show how topological crystalline defects can produce qualitatively new effects by coupling to electric field probes such as Raman scattering, even when they do not appear in the low-energy Hamiltonian but rather only in the probe response theory. To show this we consider an antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 model $H_{spin}$ on a zigzag chain. Crystalline domain walls between two zigzag domains appear as at most local defects in $H_{spin}$, but as topological (not locally creatable) defects in the Raman operator $R$ of inelastic photon scattering. Using TEBD numerics, bosonization, and mean field, we show that a finite density of crystalline domain walls shifts the entire Raman signal to produce an effective gap. This lattice-defect-induced Raman gap closes and reopens in applied magnetic fields. We discuss the effect in terms of photons sensing the lattice defects within $R$ as spin-dimerization domain walls, with $Z_2$ character, and a resulting shift of the probed wavevector from $q=0$ to $\\pi+\\delta q$, giving an $\\textit{O}(1)$ change in contrast to local defects. The magneto-Raman singularity from topological lattice defects here relies on the $H_{spin}$ spinon liquid state, suggesting future applications using lattice topological defects to modify response-theory operators independently of $H$ and thereby generate new probes of quantum phases.</p>
