                    <p class="card-text">We propose a new approach for generative modeling based on training a neural
                        network to be idempotent. An idempotent operator is one that can be applied
                        sequentially without changing the result beyond the initial application, namely
                        $f(f(z))=f(z)$. The proposed model $f$ is trained to map a source distribution
                        (e.g, Gaussian noise) to a target distribution (e.g. realistic images) using
                        the following objectives: (1) Instances from the target distribution should map
                        to themselves, namely $f(x)=x$. We define the target manifold as the set of all
                        instances that $f$ maps to themselves. (2) Instances that form the source
                        distribution should map onto the defined target manifold. This is achieved by
                        optimizing the idempotence term, $f(f(z))=f(z)$ which encourages the range of
                        $f(z)$ to be on the target manifold. Under ideal assumptions such a process
                        provably converges to the target distribution. This strategy results in a model
                        capable of generating an output in one step, maintaining a consistent latent
                        space, while also allowing sequential applications for refinement.
                        Additionally, we find that by processing inputs from both target and source
                        distributions, the model adeptly projects corrupted or modified data back to
                        the target manifold. This work is a first step towards a ``global projector''
                        that enables projecting any input into a target data distribution.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">This article addresses the lack of comprehensive studies on Web3
                        technologies, primarily due to lawyers' reluctance to explore technical
                        intricacies. Understanding the underlying technological foundations is crucial
                        to enhance the credibility of legal opinions. This article aims to illuminate
                        these foundations, debunk myths, and concentrate on determining the legal
                        status of crypto-assets in the context of property rights within the
                        distributed economy. In addition, this article notes that the intangible nature
                        of crypto-assets that derive value from distributed registries, and their
                        resistance to deletion, makes crypto-assets more akin to the autonomy of
                        intellectual property than physical media. The article presents illustrative
                        examples from common law (United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand) and civil
                        law (Germany, Austria, Poland) systems. Proposing a universal solution, it
                        advocates a comprehensive framework safeguarding digital property - data
                        ownership - extending beyond the confines of Web3.

                        This article presents a comprehensive, multi-layered approach to the analysis
                        of tokens as digital content and virtual goods. The approach, universally
                        applicable to various of such goods, scrutinizes property on three distinct
                        layers: first, the rights to the virtual good itself; second, the rights to the
                        assets linked to the virtual good; and third, the rights to the intellectual
                        property intricately associated with the token. Additionally, the paper
                        provides concise analysis of the conflict of laws rules applicable to virtual
                        goods. It also delves into issues concerning formal requirements for the
                        transfer of intellectual property rights, licensing, the first sale
                        (exhaustion) doctrine, the concept of the lawful acquirer, and other crucial
                        aspects of intellectual property in the realm of virtual goods, particularly
                        within the emerging metaverse.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">To augment language models with the ability to reason, researchers usually
                        prompt or finetune them to produce chain of thought reasoning steps before
                        producing the final answer. However, although people use natural language to
                        reason effectively, it may be that LMs could reason more effectively with some
                        intermediate computation that is not in natural language. In this work, we
                        explore an alternative reasoning approach: instead of explicitly producing the
                        chain of thought reasoning steps, we use the language model\'s internal hidden
                        states to perform implicit reasoning. The implicit reasoning steps are
                        distilled from a teacher model trained on explicit chain-of-thought reasoning,
                        and instead of doing reasoning "horizontally" by producing intermediate words
                        one-by-one, we distill it such that the reasoning happens "vertically" among
                        the hidden states in different layers. We conduct experiments on a multi-digit
                        multiplication task and a grade school math problem dataset and find that this
                        approach enables solving tasks previously not solvable without explicit
                        chain-of-thought, at a speed comparable to no chain-of-thought.</p>
